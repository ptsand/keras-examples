# Machine learning with keras

Basic machine learning examples 

## Bank customer - who's gonna leave the bank?

How to train a feedforward DNN (deep neural network) for binary classification with normalization included in the model.

## Vegetables convnet - what vegetable?

CNN (Convolutional neural network) recognizing vegetables

## XOR gate

How to fit a model with early stopping callback.
Visualization of the loss reveal a local minimum early on, which are bypassed by increasing the patience param in the callback.
In the end there's an explicit calculation of a forward pass using only the weights from keras.
